# LifeTracker
LifeTrackerPlus is an Android app implemented in Java. It allows a user to track certain functions of their life like how much they drink, work out, 
go shopping, watch TV, etc. For example, lets think of a trackable task like video games. I create "Video Games" as a trackable, and also can add attributes 
to this trackable like what game played, amount of time played, etc. You can customize if you want the app to prompt you, asking if you've played video games 
today, or you can add entries manually. All entries are saved and able to be viewed.

All in all, LifeTrackerPlus acts like a prompted journal, allowing you to track your life. It is designed to be fluid with everything that can be tracked, 
and not just one particular task.
